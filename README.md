# ModularHUD
The name is pretty self-explanatory.

## Usage
HUD module JSON files go in `/configs/modularhud/modules/`. Drag them in and start the game.

## Future Plans
- Make game resources function and make the vanilla HUD part of the mod
- Some way to allow module loading and disabling in an in-game config screen
- Server integration of some kind
